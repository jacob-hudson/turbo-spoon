# frequencytrail.r	Example frequency trail implementation.
#
# This implementation takes a density plot with a high resolution, and
# removes lines that are below a minimum threshold, by setting their value
# to NA.  This hides the zero probability line, and provide a coarse (but
# probably sufficient) view of distribution outliers.
